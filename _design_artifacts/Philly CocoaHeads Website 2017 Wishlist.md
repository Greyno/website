# Philly CocoaHeads Website 2017 Wishlist

## What does the site need to do? What questions does it need to answer?

# What do we need to acomplish on the home page?

* Explain who we are.
	* Quotes from members.
* Convince them to come to an event
* Show who we are (people pictures)
* What are the upcoming events.
* What to expect at each type of event.
* What's new on the website.



* What are the goals of the group are?
	* How do I join? 
	* Why should I participate?
* What events do we host?
	* When is the next event for each type?
	* Where is it? How do I get there?
	* What should I expect / agenda?
	* Why should I come?
	* What will I get out of it?
* Are you on Twitter?
* Need to promote and thank the sponsors
	* Need to make it clear how to sponsor / details
* Who the current leadership is? 
* How do I contact the leadership?


## Things I don't like about our current site:

* I dislike how we "blog" the meeting agenda.
* Would pref that be used for notes. Link to an announcement.
* I dislike how noisy our event email is. Think laying it out in HTML would be better. Can't send rich email in meetup.
* I think we should have more photos to help people visualize what they'll experience if they come.
* Would like to see more Meetup data sharing so we are less reliant on updating the data in multiple places.
* 


## Nice to Have Ideas for future

* Showcase member apps / projects.
* Getting Started Map / Plan for people.
* List of past meeting topics.
* Better linked in videos from Vimeo.
* Formalize sponsor presentation
* Do we want to sell more than 2 slots?
*
