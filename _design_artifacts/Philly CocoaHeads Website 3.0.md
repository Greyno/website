# Philly CocoaHeads Website 3.0

I'm going to start backward and try to describe what I'd like to see on launch. Note, there are tons of great ideas we can't fit into the first reboot launch and that's ok.

## Expectations

* I expect the site to be hosted at: phillycocoaheads.org
	* The original organizer of the group never really embraced the CocoaHeads chapter idea. Instead the group was known as "Philly Cocoa". Since I changed course on this I'd like it to finally bubble up to the domain name.
* I expect to see a new visual brand.
* I expect the home page to be very clear about:
	* The groups mission
	* Upcoming events
	* Info on How to Join/RSVP
	* Current Sponsors
	* Less Important: Recent Blog Posts, Twitter Posts, Slack Link, Photos
* I expect a dedicated section for past events
	* Events should have the original agenda, announcement, meeting notes, videos. (Future additions could include, photos, attendee list -- but probably not for launch).
* I expect a fleshed about About section  (can be basic text page, non-db driven)
	* More detail description about the group, it's past, etc.
	* Leadership contact info
	* Leadership bios (with headshot)
	* Volunteer lists and other past contributors thank yous
* I expect a simple, linked-list style blog
	* Needs support for Markdown styling, images, RSS, archive browsing
* I expect a sponsor page (can be basic text page, non-db driven)
	* Showing with detail (including images) our current sponsors and in less detail (just text) our past sponsors.
	* Info and downloadable one sheet on how to sponsor
* I expect the website to be powered by an API. This API will have a separate client (web or Macintosh) for Admin duties. The event data will be pulled in from Meetup.com for now.
* I expect the API to have a basic user authentication system

## Notes

I will acknowledge that doing a separate API, Admin Tool and Website could be simplified with a set of WordPress plugins or what not but I see these efforts as long term plays.

Even after this launch I'd still tell the members the most important thing to do is Join the Meetup group -- hopefully we can start to move that with 3.1 and 3.2.
