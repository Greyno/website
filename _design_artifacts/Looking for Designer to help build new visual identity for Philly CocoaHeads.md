# Looking for Designer to Help Build New Visual Identity for Philly CocoaHeads

Philly CocoaHeads is a local group for people doing iOS and other Apple-related development, a chapter of the world-wide CocoaHeads organization. We run monthly events in and around Philadelphia to help our members learn, socialize and share.

My name is Mike Zornek, and I help run the group which has been growing dramatically over the last few years. We currently do have a group website but are planning a major reboot and with that reboot we'd like to build a visual identity(for the website, business cards, twitter avatar, etc.). To date we haven't done much in that area, leaning on pre-built WordPress templates and a the national CocoaHeads symbol, a hand drawn mug with a happy face.

The initial scope of this project is the branding, logo, visual identity, though we may be interested with help on the overall website design as well.

This is a paying gig. If you are interested please contact Mike Zornek at <zorn@phillycocoa.org> with your availability, samples of your work and guidance on your pricing. Thank you.
