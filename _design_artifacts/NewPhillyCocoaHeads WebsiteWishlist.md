# Philly CocoaHeads Website

## Front Page 

Should be extremely obvious:

* What the group is about
* When and where the next events are
	* Main Meeting / Project Day / Workshop
* Buttons to RSVP to those events
* Buttons to join Meetup / Follow us on Twitter
* Make it clear who the current sponsors are for this month, with link to past sponsors.
* Most recent blog entries

## Other Sections/Ideas:

* Blog
	* More specifically, meeting agenda announcements and meeting notes should not be part of the blog.
	* Blog RSS should be mirrored on Twitter
* Getting Started with iOS -- feel like there is value in having a top level page for this topic, lots of links to other resources, etc.
* Past Meetings Notes / Links / Slides -- maybe just call it Archive since it's so generic.
* Past Sponsors
* Leadership Page -- Profiles of current leaderships, mentions of thanks for previous leaders.
* Member Directory -- Could be as simple as our Twitter "list" or more advanced
* Member Spotlights - List of member interviews
* Employment Exchange -- do we keep it going? Not sure it's living up to expectations.
* Talk Brainstorm -- some kind of tool to help us brainstorm talks and workshop topics.
* Contact Form for sending an email to the leadership
* Should updata main cocoaheads site db.
