## Presentations

### Learn by Teaching: The unexpected benefits of mentoring others, Kostas and YingYing Zhang

> I've been doing a good deal of informal teaching and mentoring the past few months, and exploring ways to teach programming to someone with no experience.
>
> I can talk a little bit about what I've tried, lessons learned, and my assessment of existing solutions for learning to code. And try to make the case for why all developers should mentor someone, and the unexpected benefits of doing so. I also can touch briefly on a new app-making platform we've been playing around with called [Fuse](https://www.fusetools.com/). It lets you build pretty sophisticated UI using just an HTML-like markup language. It's been really great for teaching the basic concepts of app development.

### Persistence, Curtis Herbert

> There are a lot of ways to save data in iOS, so when you're getting started it can be hard to figure out which way makes the most sense for what you're doing. We'll go over the most common ways to save and retrieve data in iOS (including code examples), along with some insights into the tradeoffs each method comes with.
