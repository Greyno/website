> 
> There will be a simple Swift 4.0 iOS 11 demo app to show the pattern in action. The app will also be available in GitHub after the talk for use as a sample pattern. 
> 
> Do you want to theme your app? MyVC. 
> Do you want reusable components? MyVC. 
> MVC is 30 years old and still works beautifully for modern apps.
