## Presentations

### Understanding the Many Ways UIViewControllers Can Load Views, Mike Zornek

> With recent changes, Xcode now forces the use of Storyboards. While such technology can be helpful it can also start to feel like "magic". In this talk we'll break down how UIViewControllers loads views, programmatically, using XIBs and finally with Storyboards.

### Using Sketch Artboards to export App Icon/Screenshots, Kotaro Fujita

> There are many ways to export the dozens of app icons and screenshots for App submission. That can be painful when you have a ton of sizes to remember. While not perfect by any means, I've made a simple way to manage this using Sketch's Artboards.

### Roundtable: Xcode Tips and Tricks

> We'll have Xcode running on the projector and will go around the room asking for their favorite tips and tricks.
