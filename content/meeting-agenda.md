## Presentations

### Apple Watch to iPhone to Apple TV, Kotaro Fujita and Aaron Bilenky

> How a childhood dream of piloting robots by your watch took Aaron and Kotaro through an interesting journey of different tech stacks with a lot of Apple's 10 core technologies behind it.

### iOS at the Art Museum, Peter W. Alt

> When I joined the Art Museum, I had no idea how deep I would get into iOS development. I'll give a brief overview over the apps we developed (and bring demos along), what working with iBeacons really means, how we're using apps that have to run 24/7 and lessons learned, including backend tools we had to develop and a quick peek at upcoming things.

### Push Notification in iOS 10, Tarika Chawla

> Showcase the differences between iOS 9 and iOS 10 push notification functions. How to make the push notifications compatible for both iOS 9 and iOS 10. Migration from iOS 9 to iOS 10.

### Visualizing gravity through Einstein’s general relativity: A Swift Playground, Hanjie Liu (Hollis)

> For this year’s WWDC student scholarship submission, I wrote a Swift Playground that simplifies and visualizes the gravitational effect of masses in the context of general relativity. I’ll demo the interactive visualization, show how a learner can code on iPad to change the behavior of the simulation, and walk through the technologies I used to build this playground.
