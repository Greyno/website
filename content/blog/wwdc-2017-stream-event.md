Similar to past years we'll be holding a local WWDC event for those of us who are not headed out west. 

On the opening Monday of the conference, June 5th, we'll meetup at IndyHall. 

From 12:30-3pm we'll stream the main Keynote, and from 5-6:30pm we'll show the Developer State of the Union. Come and go as you need.

In between, feel free to mingle with your fellow Philly CocoaHeads and IndyHall members. We'll have some snacks for the first half of the day and will order some pizzas for the second half. If you'd like to bring a snack, say so on the [main meetup event page](https://www.meetup.com/PhillyCocoaHeads/events/239280212/).

PS: We've also moved our regularly scheduled monthly meeting to be after WWDC, [Thursday, June 15th](https://www.meetup.com/PhillyCocoaHeads/events/239190782/).
