<p>Our main meeting is held once a month, usually on the second Tuesday of the month. The meeting starts at 6:30pm with a half hour of social pizza time and then breaks into presentations, covering group and industry news. We then have show and tell from the members (10-15m each) and then more formalized main talks (30m each). The meeting ends around 8:30pm but some people usually followup the meeting at a local bar for a drink or two.</p>

<p>If you have any questions or would like to present at the meeting, please get in touch with Mike Zornek, <a href="mailto:zorn@phillycocoa.org">zorn@phillycocoa.org</a>.</p>
